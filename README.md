SVG's with OpenGLes on Android
==============================

This small example was created to show how to use SVG's with OpenGLes in Android Apps. 

Use [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/) to open the project.  

The project uses [svg-android](https://code.google.com/p/svg-android/), please visit their page for more information about the SVG parsing. In short, it only supports SVG Basic 1.1. 

How it should look when you run the project,
